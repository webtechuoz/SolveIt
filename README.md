# SolveIt
SolveIt is a crowdsourced online game, which employs wisdom and intelligence of the crowd to solve location allocation problems.

Facility location allocation is key to success of urban design, mainly in designing transport systems, nding locations for warehouse, re stations and so on. The problem of determining locations of k facilities so that provides service to n customers, also known as p-median problems, is one of the well-known NP hard problems. Several heuristics have been proposed to solve location allocation problems, each of which has several limitations such as accuracy, time and exibility,
besides their advantages. here we propose to solve the p-median problems using crowdsourcing and gamication techniques. We present a crowdsourced game, called SolveIt, which employs wisdom and intelligence of the crowd to solve location allocation problems. We have presented a data model for representing p-median problems, designed and implemented the game and tested it using gold standards generated using a genetic algorithm tool. The evaluations show the accuracy of the results obtained from SolveIt players. We have also discussed the limitations and possible applications of the proposed approach.
